# AMSC808NProject2Code
All Question code is written in Python3, located in the Jupyter notebook dealwis_kusal_code.ipynb.
Folder dataset1 contains all data for problems 1 and 2.
Folder dataset2 contains all data for problems 3 and 4.
  In dataset2, I wrote a script data_to_csv.m, which converts the M and y data provided in readdata.m into CSV files.
